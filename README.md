## Overview

The project is comprised of the following:

- `index.html` - Content
- `theme.css` - CSS Styling
- `/img` - Images
- `/js` - External Scripts (Smooth-scrolling)
- `/icons` - FontAwesome's Icon Library (See below for more details)

## Page Components

### Header

The template is designed with an initial full viewport header with background image. The header is responsive but you may want to play want around with your image to make sure it looks good on a mobile phone.

#### Header Instructions

To override the stock image, you have two options:

1. Replace `img/hero.jpeg` with your own image (but keep the filename the same).
2. Replace the header `background-image` file path in `theme.css` with the path to your image.

### Details

The template is initialized with a few "Details" sections (When, Location, Lodging, etc). Change these to whatever you'd like using the HTML.
